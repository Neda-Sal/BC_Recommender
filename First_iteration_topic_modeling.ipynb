My periods come when they aren't supposed too, and then have almost completely stopped (which freaks me out). I have horrible headaches, that are just getting more frequent, and my acne has gotten worse. It's not a lot of acne, but its frequent, in the same spot and cyst like. Needless to say, it does it's job, but not the right one for me.”\n",

      "Mirena (levonorgestrel): “I am 41, have had two vaginal births. The insertion took about 3 minutes. There were two flashes of pain, a pinching, cramping feeling, and it was done. I had been terrified of the procedure, and it was genuinely fine - and I don’t have particularly high pain threshold or anything. I took deep breaths, told myself to remain calm, and it was done extremely quickly. I had cramps afterwards for about 3 minutes - pain was completely gone within minutes, and I drove home. Not a drop of pain after, but some mild (almost invisible) spotting, which stopped by the next morning. So far so good - I wonder why I didn’t do this years - decades - ago. I live in a country with universal health care so I didn’t have to pay a cent. Had I not had a prescription the IUD would have cost 100 Euros. I'm blown away at the costs I’m seeing listed above.”\n",

      "Ortho Cyclen (ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate): “The first day after taking my first pill I was extremely ill, severe nausea that interfered with my job and eventually led to vomiting. Every day after I got slightly less nauseous, and eventually towards the end of the first pack I didn’t feel sick anymore. I just ended my period and started my second pack, I take my pills at night to avoid feeling as sick. This morning after taking my first pill from the second pack last night I had the same reaction as the first pack, extreme nausea that actually woke me up and led to vomiting shortly after. I’ve also noticed I’ve been breaking out a lot in places I don’t usually break out, like my cheekbones and forehead and cheeks. I also developed very sensitive breasts that ached throughout the whole first pack, I could barely touch them. My appetite has increased substantially and I feel like I may be gaining weight already. I hope after the third pack I won’t feel sick anymore and my breasts won’t hurt as much.”\n",

      "Nexplanon (etonogestrel): “I was on the Depo Shot for 3 years and wanted to try something new. I was on my period when the Nexplanon was inserted. About 30 minutes after insertion, my period stopped. I've been on it for a year and still haven't had a period yet. It does excellent at preventing pregnancy. I've gained just 3 pounds and my weight has seemed to level out. On Depo, I was gaining 3 pounds each couple of months. My hair is very curly and thick but the hair loss is kinda freaky when showering. I'll comb it and globs of it are on the brush. Besides that, I have no other issues. Every body is different. I'm glad I chose this to protect me during college.”\n",

I was good for about a year never got pregnant but just recently I noticed I had severe side effects from depression to being angry all of the time. I even started to get irritated \"down there\" after every cycle. I just switched to Tri-Sprintec so hopefully this works wonders. Don't go off of my horrible experience every ones body is different.”\n",

Changes I've noticed since I have it: heavier periods and heavy cramping. I have spotting up to a week before my period and cramps that are really strong. I have had more vaginal discharge, like everyday almost. And the vaginal odors are more noticeable but not horrible. BUT all this is worth it because there is no hormones, and you don't have to worry about forgetting to take a pill.”\n",

I went to my doctor and just wanted a easier carefree form of birth control. We talked about Nexplanon and the IUD but I just didn't want the IUD. I have had my normal time of the month for the first two weeks but it was a lot shorter and lighter, which is crazy because my period was like 3 days to begin with and no symptoms.

They supposedly have the same ingredients but Orsythia really made me feel awful. Here is what went on. Every month was different, some months I was extremely emotional, other months my breasts would get very tender, all the way through the nipple, ouch! I would also get frequent headaches, like maybe 4 a week, There was more cramping too. I connected the dots and told my Dr. and she switched me back to lutera and put on the prescription that there should be no substitutions. I have been fine for the past 6 months since I changed back. Orsythia sucks if you ask me.”\n",

      "Alesse (ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel): “Started taking Aleese 4 months after first baby. Within the first 24hrs I developed a headache. For a week I took my pill same time everyday. On day 7 my headache had become unbearably bad. By the next morning I started pain puking unable to open my right eye. I went into emergency at the hospital and was treated for a migraine... a migraine was not what the problem was I have a blood clot in my brain caused by being on this pill for 1 week. I am now on blood thinners and treatment for the clot luckily I did not keep waiting for what I thought was my body adjusting to this bc. I saved my life by going to the hospital.”\n",

But the amount of anxiety I was experiencing was not like usual. I was waking up almost every night in panic attacks and tossing and turning not being able to fall asleep. Then it started throughout the day, me being anxious just watching a movie, my mind would be racing. I remember not really being able to pin point what my anxiety was from but I woke up one morning and realized the new thing I’ve been taking is birth control.

I have irregular periods so I went on birth control to regulate them. But by the second week of my second pack I felt extreme high anxiety. I’m not normally an anxious person, you know some anxiety here and there. But the amount of anxiety I was experiencing was not like usual. I was waking up almost every night in panic attacks and tossing and turning not being able to fall asleep. Then it started throughout the day, me being anxious just watching a movie, my mind would be racing. I remember not really being able to pin point what my anxiety was from but I woke up one morning and realized the new thing I’ve been taking is birth control. So I stopped it and noticed throughout the day already it has been much better with anxiety. Sometimes in the night I’m still anxious but I just stopped it a day ago.I don’t recommend this pill.”\n",

I had mood swings, worsened anxiety and depression, and I was tired all the time. The pros of this pill were decreased acne and my boobs got bigger! My period is also now 3 days instead of 7 and I have basically no cramps. The reason I started taking the pill was because of my extremely painful cramps and it did its job of taking them away which I am grateful for. I have recently realized I have been getting panic attacks a week before my period and I am not sure if it is because of the birth control or just me.”\n",

Immediately after it was placed I got sweaty, hot, nauseous, and dizzy, and almost passed out. I couldn't drive home and I certainly couldn't go to work (I called off). After that the cramps I had were so painful and intense I couldn't move. I threw up once from the pain. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen and the pain only SLIGHTLY subsided.

The first couple of days after each shot I experience some migraines and nausea, but really that’s the only complaint I have. I haven’t had a single period since my first shot, and it kind of worried me and had me thinking I was pregnant. But when I went back to get my second shot they told me it was pretty normal but pregnancy tested me just in case and I wasn’t so that’s good! I have gained around 10 pounds, but considering I was 90 pounds when I got on the shot I think that’s a plus for me! It’s also free for me so I love that!”\n",

I had acne when I had the Implanon put in and it cleared my acne up. I do have breakouts once and a while. But I am in my last year and I hate it now. I have been bleeding for six months now.

Don't be scared by the negative reviews. If the Implanon isn't for you, its easy to have it removed and symptoms are taken with it. When I first got the Implanon I had irregular periods for a couple of months but eventually they formed a pattern and I got them every 6 weeks. Since I have had my second Implanon I haven't had a period at all. The chances of falling pregnant on the Implanon are very slim but I rely on the occasional pregnancy test just to make sure. ”\n",

The past 3 years have been horrible with this side effect. After doing research I have found that this may be permanent even after Implanon being removed.

The only reason I had it removed was because I would have a heavy period for months at a time. I was on my period for more than half the time I had the Implanon. When I had it removed, I noticed my face clear up and I lost a small amount of weight. I have a friend who had Implanon and she had it removed due to complete lack of periods.
