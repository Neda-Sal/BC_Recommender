So here is my happy story! I was using the ring for a couple years before I tried Mirena. The ring made me miserable, hormonal, moody, irregular. I was very depressed from the fluctuating hormones. In comes Mirena. The Mirena has been the best choice I have ever made for myself. It is true what all my friends and reviewers say. I do not feel hormonal or moody. In fact I feel much more balanced! My skin does break out at times but I will happily take that over what I was experiencing before. My periods have stopped and I sometimes pms about a week before what WOULD be my period, but it is very mild and manageable. Sooo happy with my Mirena!!!

Had another put in a few years later which didn’t sit as well as the first.. had weird bleeding and I was super moody, gained weight. I was so surprised because the first one I had was awesome. It was recommended to me because I was still breastfeeding. I had it removed about 8 months later to conceive again. Conceived within 3 months of removal which ended in miscarriage and had a D and C. Since the D and C I’ve had severe abnormal bleeding, haven’t ovulated in over a year, PCOS, plus more.. so my specialist put in another Mirena to ‘reset’ my hormones and stop the bleeding and it has been so great.

I have a dull headache every day. I am dizzy nearly all of the time, I have developed some facial hair and my hair is falling out of my scalp. I have insomnia. This is incredibly frustrating to me as my GP keeps writing it off as \"general anxiety\". I did not have these issues before Mirena.

The OB was taking an ultrasound at the same time as she was inserting it to check which direction my uterus was towards which helped instead of guessing (mine was forward which made it harder for her). We were both shocked when she asked if I was okay and didn't even know it went in. I then went home expecting cramping and it never came. I never had any cramping but only spotting.

These Mirena side effects gradually developed so I didn’t link it and drs dismissed it (my gut is fine now after removal!!.). 2 weeks after removal the crash hit. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety, depression, brain fog, headaches and sore throat. I can't function. I think my body has stopped making progesterone (in the brain, adrenals and ovaries) because I have had the artificial form from Mirena for 5+ years. It’s not localised hormone and isn't metabolised the same. When it’s removed your body is thrown into a severe imbalance that takes months to rectify. I’m still healing and feel frustrated that 5yrs of anxiety and gut issues could also been avoided. These issues aren’t rare, and it’s affecting a large % of woman. I hope this warns people or gives comfort to those going through it.

I have found it impossible to lose weight while breastfeeding and on a low carb diet plan. I feel fatigued almost all the time despite getting regular sleep. I don't know if my mood is affected, I've experienced major losses in life lately, so it's hard to know if Mirena is affecting my moods, or if I'm sad because my mother has severe early onset dementia and my mother-in-law died recently. Also, my libido is pretty low. I want to schedule to have the Mirena removed, I'm tired of feeling pregnant all the time when I'm not! I might try the pill or the pull out method. Those two methods have always worked for me. Also the Mirena has recently caused my legs to itch like crazy. This happened during my last trimester of pregnancy. After delivery the itching went away. But now that I have the Mirena the itching came back. So this along with fatigue, low libido, constant lower belly bloating, and inability to lose any weight despite breastfeeding and low carb diet.

I had become deeply depressed and in such a dark place. I had had some depression before in my life, but this was a deep depression that made me question my existence. My depression got worse over the next 3 years. My doctor put my on an antipsychotic to help with depression. I gained about 45 lbs from the antipsychotic. My depression got worse and I was at my lowest In 2018, I looked up Mirena on the internet and saw many stories and studies about it being linked to depression. I talked to my doctor, who assured me the progesterone in the Mirena was localized and could not be the cause. In November of 2018, I had it removed. Around January 2019, I was a completely different person! I had lifted from the cloud of darkness. I returned to the person I was in 2014, before the Mirena.

I have had the IUD in place for 4 days now and have had minimal spotting and minimal cramping. I will update this is about three months. If you are considering the Mirena, please do not make your choice based on reviews from others. As I stated before people are quick to complain but rarely reach out to leave positive reviews.”\\n10 / 10\\nWas this helpful?   Yes   No\\n32 · Report',\n",

Following insertion, I felt like I was being poked - pretty severely from time to time - from the inside out. This was despite a completely normal placement of the device according to an ultrasound performed a few weeks after insertion.

Immediately I had major contraction pains which took my breath away. These went on for nearly two months. I also had an insatiable hunger. This lasted for 3 months and then every 2 weeks thereafter. I also bled seriously heavily for the first 3 weeks and then had light bleeding every day. Back and hip pain was also a permanent fixture from day 1 of insertion. I also had mood swings which made me feel very anxious and angry. My stomach was ALWAYS bloated and really uncomfortable every day with mild and sometimes severe cramp. I weighed my self. Despite not putting on weight in 3 years previous to the Mirena, I'd gained 12 pounds within 4 months of having the coil fitted. It is now January 2019.

I didn't attributes any major weight gain to the IUD. Since the 5 years was up in 2015 I had it removed. Since I was over 42 the time, we decided to give my body a break from the hormones. I also thought it less likely would get pregnant due to my advanced maternal age. Well I got pregnant within a year and had a miscarriage. I got pregnant again and had another miscarriage. At 45 I didn't think the pregnancies and DNC was good for me. I got another IUD March 2018. So far, I'm experiencing heavier periods, spotting and cramps. I did not have this experience previously. I'm told to wait it out at least 4 months. I'm waiting it out, but I'm hesitant and thing of having it removed. I don't like how I feel now.”\\n8 / 10\\nWas this helpful?

Like bloating, constipation or acne after eating to much sugar/salt/lipids... you will know of that is your case. So the first month with Mirena was really painful. Uterine cramps at every end of the day and some spotting. From the first month I completely lost my period. I also completely lost my libido, which has never been so strong as I had always took hormones as birth control (previously on pills) For the past 2 years I had mild acne like 3-4 pimples every month. But with Mirena, my face was covered with it. Mostly around my mouth and on my forehead (but then it spread to my cheeks) I lost all my self confidence. I removed mirena after 6 months and my doctor gave me minocycline 500mg 2x a day + topical/acid cream. I am now on IUD Mona Lisa (copper IUD) and I didn't have a single cramp after its insertion + my libido has never been this strong it's 100% natural, no hormones, and cost pennies comparatevly to Mirena! ”\\n1 / 10\\nWas this helpful?

I bled constantly, (in an array of colours!) for the obligatory 3 months that the GP told me to wait, until my body got used to it. Then it was another month before I finally went back to my GP and said \"Help\". She gave me a progesterone pill told me to take it for a month. I only took it for only one week! It did the job, I stopped bleeding and have gone on to a normal cycle. My periods only last a couple of days, do not hurt and are light, (just a smear of blood).

No, not so far. I was worried about this, however I am happy to say that I have noticed no difference. Sex is just as welcome and enjoyable as before. 5) Would I get spots?

I gained 20 pounds, which is odd as I eat well most of the time & go jogging with my boyfriend. Even he is now convinced that my lack of a sex drive, weight gain & inability to loose weight is a side effect of the Mirena.

I had it inserted 3 months after having my 2nd child and it took no more than 10 min for my Dr to do it. I loved having mirena for 5 years as I didn't have to worry about birth control at all! The only minus is that for first year or two I had irregular bleeding or to be correct spotting. It wasn't really a period but every couple of weeks I'd have to use slim daily pads for couple of days at a time. Still, it is much much better than having regular painful periods and to worry about birth control every day. So, I'm having my removed in a month and probably will give my uterus a rest for 2-3 month (if it's necessary I don't know... Maybe not) and get another one.”\\n9 / 10\\nWas this helpful?

I am small-build (5'0), never had children. It was really not that bad. Three rather severe cramps - but nothing worse than I have had with a particularly bad period. I had no local anesthetic and I took 800mg ibuprofen one hour beforehand. It was inserted less than an hour ago and I am back at work and feeling fine. I think one thing that may make a difference is the experience of the nurse practitioner or doctor performing the procedure. The more experienced, the faster. Mine took less than three minutes total.

Having \"normal\" periods after having 2 children is a very humbling experience. Ok, after babies, it is expected. But once those initial hormones subsided and things went back to “normal”, it was absolute hell. The worst PMS. Cramping that was like contractions, heavy flows requiring me to stay home. Oh and did I mention the PMS? I want to kill everyone. Absolute rage and depression for up to 2 weeks before starting. I only have a 26 day cycle now, so I would literally be ovulating, on my period or PMSing the entire month. It is miserable. Let\\'s talk about ovulating. I track and abstaining from sex during high fertility days using an iPhone app. It works well. But here’s the “side effects\" of that: I’ve never wanted sex more, and when you have two young kids, it’s absolute torture. When I finally could have sex (and it was great!) then would start the “fear” for the next two weeks worrying that I would be pregnant. Then the PMS sets in and I act worse then I ever did on nuvaring. Oh yeah, and I get BV after each period anyway. I can’t lose weight (did the nuvaring help me lose weight too?) so what’s the point of the fertility awareness method? To have balanced hormones? Guess what ladies: they ain’t balanced. I’ve been trying to balance them for the last 8 years. So here I go back on the nuvaring because I’d rather not worry about getting pregnant anymore, y’all. I’ll be proactive and still take my supplements when I get nauseated, I’ll take my 5HTP and L-theanine when I feel full of rage or anxiety. I’ll take my probiotics to keep my vagina PH in balance.
