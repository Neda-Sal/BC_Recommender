C\"},{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"MedicalCondition\",\"name\":\"Birth Control\",\"description\":\"<p>Contraception is the deliberate use of a medicine, device, or a technique to prevent pregnancy that has the potential to happen during sexual intercourse. Contraception may also be called birth control. A contraceptive is the name given to any medicine or device used for contraception.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What are Contraceptives Used For?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Contraceptives are mostly used for contraception (to help prevent women from becoming pregnant). However, sometimes hormonal contraceptives may also be prescribed to:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Help with acne control</li>\\r\\n<li>Help regulate periods</li>\\r\\n<li>Prevent ovulation and pregnancy in women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)</li>\\r\\n<li>Reduce pain and cramping during menstruation</li>\\r\\n<li>Reduce the symptoms of endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Emergency contraceptives are contraceptives that are taken (or inserted if an IUD) within a few days after unprotected sex to help prevent implantation of a fertilized egg and possible resulting pregnancy.</p>\\r\\n<p>Condoms are contraceptives that may be used to reduce the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, although protection is not 100%.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What are the Differences Between Contraceptives?</h2>\\r\\n<p>There are several differences between contraceptives. The main difference is that some contain hormones whereas others do not. Hormone-containing contraceptives have more side effects than nonhormonal contraceptives. Some combined hormonal contraceptives also contain supplements such as iron or folic acid.</p>\\r\\n<p>The following are different types of contraceptives:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs): These contain an estrogen and a progestin to prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from an ovary), thin the uterine lining, and thicken cervical mucus making it impenetrable to sperm</li>\\r\\n<li>Progestin-only contraceptives (POPs): These contain just one hormone, progestin. Most work by thickening cervical mucus, preventing sperm from entering the uterus. POPs must be taken within the same three hours every day</li>\\r\\n<li>Hormonal contraceptive patch:One patch is applied each week for every three weeks, then usually followed by a patch-free week</li>\\r\\n<li>Hormonal contraceptive rings: One ring is inserted into the vagina and remains in place continuously for three weeks, then removed for a one week break before a new ring is inserted</li>\\r\\n<li>Hormonal shot/injection: An injection is administered under the skin once every 3 months (12 to 14 weeks)</li>\\r\\n<li>Intrauterine devices (IUD): Small, T-shaped device that is inserted through the vagina into the uterus to prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Lasts 3 to 10 years depending on the type</li>\\r\\n<li>Implantable rods: Small rod the size of a matchstick that is implanted under the skin of the upper arm. Lasts up to 3 years</li>\\r\\n<li>Female condom: Must be used every time that sex occurs. Provides some protection against STIs</li>\\r\\n<li>Male condom: Contain either latex, polyurethane, or polyisoprene. Must be used every time that sex occurs. Provide some protection against STIs</li>\\r\\n<li>Cervical cap/diaphragm with spermicide: A soft silicone cup that covers the cervix and is inserted before sex. May irritate, cause allergic reactions, and increase the risk of an abnormal Pap test</li>\\r\\n<li>Sponge with spermicide: Soft polyurethane sponge that is inserted before sex and kept in place for six hours after sex</li>\\r\\n<li>Spermicide alone: Must be used every time that sex occurs. Not very reliable. May irritate, cause allergic reactions, and increase the risk of STIs and UTIs.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Emergency hormonal contraception</h3>\\r\\n<p>The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP), sometimes called the &lsquo;morning-after pill&rsquo; may be taken to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, contraceptive failure, or after a sexual assault. Levonorgestrel ECPs work best if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex; however, they are still moderately effective if used within five days of unprotected sex. The ulipristal ECP can be used within five days of unprotected sex.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Is Contraception Safe?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Some types of contraception may not be suitable for some people.</p>\\r\\n<p>Hormonal contraceptives are not recommended in women with certain types of cancer, at higher risk of clotting or strokes, liver disease, severe headaches, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, uncontrolled high blood pressure or heart disease. Nonhormonal methods of contraception are more suitable for these women. Women who are pregnant who still wish to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections should use barrier methods of contraception (such as condoms).</p>\\r\\n<p>Serious side effects associated with hormonal contraceptives include:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blurred vision</li>\\r\\n<li>Chest pain and an increased risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke</li>\\r\\n<li>Leg pain or swelling</li>\\r\\n<li>A severe headache</li>\\r\\n<li>Severe stomach pain</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Smoking increases the risk of serious heart side effects with COCs (includes the hormonal ring or patch). COCs should NOT be used in women aged over 35 years who smoke because they are at higher risk of serious side effects such as heart attack, blood clots, or stroke.</p>\\r\\n<p>Certain medications and some supplements can make hormonal contraceptives less effective. Hormonal contraceptives do not offer any protection against STIs such as HIV or hepatitis. Male or female condoms should be used in combination with hormonal contraceptives if protection against STIs is needed.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What are Common Side Effects Associated With Contraception?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Hormonal contraceptives have been associated with several different side effects such as:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Acne</li>\\r\\n<li>Appetite changes</li>\\r\\n<li>Breast tenderness, enlargement or discharge</li>\\r\\n<li>Changes to menstrual flow, bleeding or spotting between periods, painful or missed periods</li>\\r\\n<li>Constipation or diarrhea</li>\\r\\n<li>Gingivitis (inflammation of the gums)</li>\\r\\n<li>Hair growth in unusual places</li>\\r\\n<li>Mood changes</li>\\r\\n<li>Nausea</li>\\r\\n<li>Skin color changes (brown or black patches)</li>\\r\\n<li>Stomach cramps or bloating</li>\\r\\n<li>Weight gain or loss</li>\\r\\n<li>Vaginal burning, discharge, irritation, itching, redness, or swelling</li>\\r\\n<li>Vomiting.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Nonhormonal contraceptives may be associated with irritation, itching, redness, or discomfort during sex.</p>\\r\\n\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"MedicalWebPage\",\"@id\":\"https://www.drugs.com/condition/contraception.html\",\"url\":\"https://www.drugs.com/condition/contraception.html\"},\"drug\":[{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Drug\",\"url\":\"https://www.drugs.com/mirena.html\",\"name\":\"Mirena\",\"isProprietary\":true,\"alternateName\":\"levonorgestrel\",\"nonProprietaryName\":\"levonorgestrel\",\"prescriptionStatus\":\"Prescription

Women who are pregnant who still wish to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections should use barrier methods of contraception (such as condoms).\n",

      "“Decided to try Mirena after baby #2. Inserted February 2019. Insertion was painful but expected. Period bleeding reduced to nothing after 3 months. Give it a 4 for doing that but the rest of the side affects are overwhelming. The first 3 months were awful with mood swings. Extreme sensitivity, crying spells, extreme anger, couldn’t handle the children or spouse anymore, patience disappeared. Extreme fatigue to this day. At 3 month check up my OB convinced me in keeping it longer saying symptoms should improve with time. Now 8 months later still very emotional, and it increases with intensity a week before my period. Also have horrible bloating and developed hormonal and cystic acne. Just now having weight gain. Gained 11lbs these past 2 months, as much as 5 lbs in a week because of bloating. I was 119lbs before the IUD and now 130lbs. I have not changed diet or activity. Clothes I just bought 2 months ago no longer fit me. I’m considering having Mirena removed.”\n",

Insertion was painful but brief. I don't have to worry about remembering anything, It doesn't contain estrogen (I get migraines), and it lasts five years. Wohoo!”\n",

      "“I had my Mirena inserted in March 2017, because my husband & I didn’t want anymore kids. The insertion wasn’t bad, it didn’t bother me. I had irregular bleeding for about 2 months, then no more periods. I had a healthy sex drive, that crumbled with Mirena. I thought it was unrelated to the Mirena, my Dr said it couldn’t be the Mirena. I couldn’t lose weight & always felt bloated. My skin was constantly breaking out with acne. My husband & I agreed for him to get a vasectomy. I had the Mirena taken out in August 2019. I didn’t even feel him take it out. A) I started to lose weight & that constant bloated feeling B) My sex drive is back to what it used to be, I felt broken for over 2 years C) My skin is clear D) I have energy & lost that feeling of depression & fatigue. Listen to your body, everyone is different, my Dr tried to convince me to keep it in, but I choose what was best for me.

      "“I had Mirena inserted at my 6-week postpartum checkup. It hurt a lot when placing it, I was experiencing my first period since giving birth so the whole procedure was a mess. A week later I kept feeling the strings in the vagina, I could feel the device inside my uterus too. It was uncomfortable and so I went to the emergency room where they did an ultrasound and a vaginal exam. Everything came back normal. The Mirena definitely helped stop the heavy bleeding I was having, then I got my period the next month then nothing. I had the IUD removed last week due to the ongoing discomfort I felt. For the 10 months I had it in, I had low sex drive, no periods, the sensation that something was stuck in there, and a huge amount of hormonal-related mood swings. I now feel fantastic!! I feel happier, I feel nothing in my uterus or vagina that hurts. I enjoy being a woman again, though I have been spotting since having it removed for about one week.”\n",

I had it placed 4 years ago and I will definitely get another after this. Insertion was painful, no doubt, but after a few days of cramping I have had no issues at all. My period is almost non-existent, I do have some hormonal acne, which I also had prior to Mirena- it hasn't gotten worse but it hasn't improved, either. I still get monthly period symptoms like bloating, but no bleeding. My sex drive is the same (quite high) and I have so much peace of mind with Mirena.

My partner at times feels the strings during intercourse and I still at times have heavy cramping and menstrual discharge. The hormone in Mirena is progestin and it does not suppress ovulation.

I got it remove today 9/30/19!! While having the Mirena I felt like I was high all the time, dizzy my mind would wonder couldn’t stay focus, couldn’t sleep at night, weird dreams.

      "“I decided 3 years after having endometriosis removed and done having children, to try an IUD. Last time I was on any BC was 15 years ago. My periods are usually 4 days long and never have any cramping. I do tend to get overwhelmed about 4-7 days before my period. My emotions are more challenging to rein in. I do get ovulation pain. I thought that an IUD would level out the hormones and make my emotions easier to manage. I had an IUD on Friday 09/27/2019. I spent 24 hours in cramping pain and tiredness. Lots of brown discharge in the first day. The progestin made me bloated/gassy. Saturday and Sunday I felt in a brain fog and couldn't think clearly or just enjoy being (just like when I was on micronor). I was very much aware of the device and pressure in my uterus. My pre flow was noticeably reduced. Then all last night I was up with cystitis. Urgency and frequency and barely any pee coming out. I decided to take back control and removed it first this on Monday morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to get the Mirena removed after 9 months due to constant groin pains, severe acne (just appeared out of nowhere) and heavy periods. I thought suffering through after the 3 month mark would eventually lead to get better but it ended up hurting me in the long run. So if you have any type of symptoms please don’t hesitate to make an appointment with your gyno! Make sure you’re not allergic to levonorgestrel (as if you had a bad reaction to the bc pills) as well beforehand! I just don’t want anyone to experience the same situation I had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had the Mirena placed in March. It was a little uncomfortable but only during the procedure. My period was light almost immediately. Fast forward until today and I’ve had increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, went to the ER and told it was anxiety and dehydration. Nothing in my life has changed since March! Everything is dry. My eyes, my skin, my hair is brittle and I feel like I shed like a dog, my hands and toes always feel like they are falling asleep. I bruise like crazy. The mood swings and dark depression suck. It may be that I cannot tolerate this amount of hormones but I can’t feel the strings anymore and will see the doctor on Monday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The worst 6 months of my life was on Mirena. Insertion was horrific but no where near as bad as the next 6 months after insertion. 3 days after insertion I began bleeding and it never stopped. It changed my mood, I became depressed to the point I couldn't get out of bed or do my job, caused fatigue and brain fog. Libido decreased severely. Honestly thought I was going to die and the doctors wouldn't believe that the coil could be causing any of my symptoms. After 6 months I had enough and had it removed. Since life has got better but libido is nowhere near what it used to be and depression remains. I was a very happy normal 27 year old and it changed my life. I wish I had never had it put in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After 6 months of breakthrough bleeding and a 15lb weight gain, I decided to have my Mirena yanked out. The removal was painless but I was not prepared for was the flood of bleeding and cramping that ensued for the few days after having it removed. I'm actually quite sad Mirena didn't work for me. I have a few friends who use it and its wonderful - - little to no period and no remembering pills. I guess thats how it is though, you dont know how it will work out for you unless you try it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I got the Mirena inserted in January 2015 and will be getting it removed soon as it is only good for up to 5 years. Here are my thoughts on this IUD. PROS: - No pregnancy. - No periods for the last 4 years. - No acne. - No weight gain. CONS: - NO SEX DRIVE AT ALL. - Insertion was 9/10 on pain scale. - Partners can feel strings during intercourse. - Spotting occasionally for first year. - Can worsen symptoms of mental illness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mirena has been a miracle for me. I suffered from severely heavy and painful menstruation from age 11 to 28 that eventually caused me to become anemic. I tried all kinds of oral contraception and had awful side effects on all of them. I got my Mirena 4.5 years ago and my periods have been light and short ever since with no significant side effects. Insertion was painful, but quick and completely worth it for me. This thing saved me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“After having paraguard for 3 years I had it taken out due to heavy cramping and bleeding. I switched to Mirena and had no period at all. I took it out though because it still was causing cramping. I also think it caused me to have an abnormal pap from HPV being stronger due to my immune system being weakened from this foreign object invasion inside.. back on the pill I go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first three months on Mirena my emotions were through the roof never had such bad anxiety I was crying constantly and lived in fear. Also sex hurt now not because the coil was in the way or anything my cervix area just hurt. So I read up online and reviews say to leave it for a year. Give it a chance. I left it for the year I learnt to live with my new found anxiety I started to see a therapist and we couldn’t work out why I was getting anxiety I don’t drink caffeine I exercise daily I have my own home an amazing job and bf but nothing quite shook it. So fast forward a year! So off to the doctor I went, had it removed and they said that I’d know within the month if it’s the hormones that had been affecting me, in fact I’d know rather quickly. Behold two weeks out and life is good! My bf is shocked he said it’s like I have transformed into my old self, no anxiety at all!! Nothing!!! My skin is clearing up! My confidence is back and sex doesn’t hurt”\n",

      "“I lost 3 years of my life due to using a Mirena. In 2015, I got the IUD. A few months later, I sought help for depression. I had become deeply depressed and in such a dark place. I had had some depression before in my life, but this was a deep depression that made me question my existence. My depression got worse over the next 3 years. My doctor put my on an antipsychotic to help with depression. I gained about 45 lbs from the antipsychotic. My depression got worse and I was at my lowest In 2018, I looked up Mirena on the internet and saw many stories and studies about it being linked to depression. I talked to my doctor, who assured me the progesterone in the Mirena was localized and could not be the cause. In November of 2018, I had it removed. Around January 2019, I was a completely different person! I had lifted from the cloud of darkness. I returned to the person I was in 2014, before the Mirena. I have been depression free ever since having it removed.”\n",

      "“Mirena has worked for what is has promised in regards to ceasing the ability to become pregnant, but it's just not worth it for me. In the three years I've had it placed, just after my daughter was born, I've had random and severe cramping shooting from my abdomen to my thighs and knees. I've had really bad acne, which has left some severe scars, and hair growing where it absolutely SHOULDN'T for a young woman! Unpredictable periods, lasting mood swings, debilitating anxiety, and for a few months, an increasingly crippling depression so dark and hopeless that life was just a chore. Screwing with your hormones is a very bad idea ladies, if it involves these risks. Every birth control I've ever been on has caused problems similar to this. I think maybe it's time we take back our bodies and stop using these types of bc (pills, injection, IUD, implants)”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s been 5 months since I had Mirena inserted. I’m 40, just had my 2nd and last child a year ago, the procedure is nowhere near giving birth without epidural. It was quick, took less than a minute and just a bit of discomfort. First week was uncomfortable, I can feel it as I move around. There was no bleeding. 2nd week was when the bleeding started and lasted for a month. It took 3 weeks to stop feeling the IUD. Up until 2 months ago I have occasional spotting, but only for a day whereas I used to get heavy bleeding and cramping that I have to take Advil. I didn’t see any weight gain, mood swings, acne. My sex drive is still the same, however there was a couple of times where I could feel it during sex which was uncomfortable. The last few times I had sex, I didn’t feel it at all and no spotting from those times. I did notice that I’m a lot warmer than before. I love it because I don’t have to worry about periods on vacation or playing sports.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no doubt that I would recommend this form of birth control, it is very effective and I never have to worry about being pregnant, it also regulated my period after a few months and shortened it. But one thingy my doctor never told me was that if you already had hormonal acne, it definitely makes it worse. If you’re the type of girl who got on the pill to help with acne I would not recommend this! I’m in my junior year of college and through high school never had any acne, but now I have it everywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I loved my experience with Mirena. I got it inserted in March of 2015 and just had it removed this week, to get a new one. It has been completely effective in terms of pregnancy, and it stopped my periods altogether. I never even had symptoms of a period with this, and no spotting. The insertion hurt a bit, but it was more uncomfortable than anything. I never had any side effects, and recommend this to all my friends. It's so easy, and I'm happy I got it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have lived on this website the past few days reading reviews about all the IUDs, freaking out about the insertion. But I had to keep in mind each experience is different. I have had Severe PMS in the past and have been on birth control pills to help with the serious cramps and heavy flow. I also have IBS which gives severe cramps. So seriously how bad could this be? The first few things they did didn't hurt, but once they started measuring my uterus, I was in excruciating pain. A procedure that should've taken 2-3 minutes, took about 10+ agonizing minutes. After almost passing out and hyperventilating, it was finally over. I have been home for the past few hours switching between walking, laying with a heating pad, and taking baths. The cramps are awful at times and then gone at other times. I haven't experienced bleeding yet. I'll update here in a few months”\n",
      "\n",
      "“3 weeks into having Mirena, I started to experience a significant decline in my sex drive, plus I had mood swings, depression (which I can only describe as a constant feeling of impending doom), anxiety, and acne in places I've had never had it before. The spotting was on and off with small blood clots and brown, sticky discharge in between spotting (not romantic at all). I don't know whether this is because of Mirena or not, but I also started to notice a huge decrease in the amount of natural lubrication my body was producing before sex.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I've experienced all of the symptoms that you don't want to have , cramps, pelvic pain, weight gain . My sister has the Mirena and she has no issues. However, I felt horrible from the first day up until my removal date 2 1/2 years later. I experience severe mood swings, depression, dark thoughts, severe anxiety, pelvic pain and cramping, severe bloating and headaches, dizziness and weight gain. People would constantly ask me if I was expecting because of the belly bloat. When I went to have it removed, it came out in a way it wasn't supposed to making my Obgyn believe it never fully opened up and was inserted incorrectly in me. Overall, I had a bad experience and I am doing so much better than when I had it in me.”\n",

I thought that an IUD would level out the hormones and make my emotions easier to manage. I had an IUD on Friday 09/27/2019. I spent 24 hours in cramping pain and tiredness. Lots of brown discharge in the first day. The progestin made me bloated/gassy. Saturday and Sunday I felt in a brain fog and couldn't think clearly or just enjoy being (just like when I was on micronor). I was very much aware of the device and pressure in my uterus. My pre flow was noticeably reduced. Then all last night I was up with cystitis. Urgency and frequency and barely any pee coming out. I decided to take back control and removed it first this on Monday morning.”\n",

I thought suffering through after the 3 month mark would eventually lead to get better but it ended up hurting me in the long run. So if you have any type of symptoms please don’t hesitate to make an appointment with your gyno! Make sure you’re not allergic to levonorgestrel (as if you had a bad reaction to the bc pills) as well beforehand! I just don’t want anyone to experience the same situation I had.”\n",

Fast forward until today and I’ve had increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, went to the ER and told it was anxiety and dehydration. Nothing in my life has changed since March! Everything is dry. My eyes, my skin, my hair is brittle and I feel like I shed like a dog, my hands and toes always feel like they are falling asleep. I bruise like crazy. The mood swings and dark depression suck. It may be that I cannot tolerate this amount of hormones but I can’t feel the strings anymore and will see the doctor on Monday.”\n",

Insertion was horrific but no where near as bad as the next 6 months after insertion. 3 days after insertion I began bleeding and it never stopped. It changed my mood, I became depressed to the point I couldn't get out of bed or do my job, caused fatigue and brain fog. Libido decreased severely. Honestly thought I was going to die and the doctors wouldn't believe that the coil could be causing any of my symptoms. After 6 months I had enough and had it removed. Since life has got better but libido is nowhere near what it used to be and depression remains. I was a very happy normal 27 year old and it changed my life. I wish I had never had it put in.”\n",

CONS: - NO SEX DRIVE AT ALL. - Insertion was 9/10 on pain scale. - Partners can feel strings during intercourse. - Spotting occasionally for first year. - Can worsen symptoms of mental illness.”\n",

Also sex hurt now not because the coil was in the way or anything my cervix area just hurt. So I read up online and reviews say to leave it for a year. Give it a chance. I left it for the year I learnt to live with my new found anxiety I started to see a therapist and we couldn’t work out why I was getting anxiety I don’t drink caffeine I exercise daily I have my own home an amazing job and bf but nothing quite shook it. So fast forward a year! So off to the doctor I went, had it removed and they said that I’d know within the month if it’s the hormones that had been affecting me, in fact I’d know rather quickly. Behold two weeks out and life is good! My bf is shocked he said it’s like I have transformed into my old self, no anxiety at all!! Nothing!!! My skin is clearing up!

I had had some depression before in my life, but this was a deep depression that made me question my existence. My depression got worse over the next 3 years. My doctor put my on an antipsychotic to help with depression. I gained about 45 lbs from the antipsychotic. My depression got worse and I was at my lowest In 2018, I looked up Mirena on the internet and saw many stories and studies about it being linked to depression. I talked to my doctor, who assured me the progesterone in the Mirena was localized and could not be the cause. In November of 2018, I had it removed. Around January 2019, I was a completely different person! I had lifted from the cloud of darkness. I returned to the person I was in 2014, before the Mirena. I have been depression free ever since having it removed.”\n",

In the three years I've had it placed, just after my daughter was born, I've had random and severe cramping shooting from my abdomen to my thighs and knees. I've had really bad acne, which has left some severe scars, and hair growing where it absolutely SHOULDN'T for a young woman! Unpredictable periods, lasting mood swings, debilitating anxiety, and for a few months, an increasingly crippling depression so dark and hopeless that life was just a chore. Screwing with your hormones is a very bad idea ladies, if it involves these risks. Every birth control I've ever been on has caused problems similar to this. I think maybe it's time we take back our bodies and stop using these types of bc (pills, injection, IUD, implants)”\n",

It was quick, took less than a minute and just a bit of discomfort. First week was uncomfortable, I can feel it as I move around. There was no bleeding. 2nd week was when the bleeding started and lasted for a month. It took 3 weeks to stop feeling the IUD. Up until 2 months ago I have occasional spotting, but only for a day whereas I used to get heavy bleeding and cramping that I have to take Advil. I didn’t see any weight gain, mood swings, acne. My sex drive is still the same, however there was a couple of times where I could feel it during sex which was uncomfortable. The last few times I had sex, I didn’t feel it at all and no spotting from those times. I did notice that I’m a lot warmer than before. I love it because I don’t have to worry about periods on vacation or playing sports.”\n",
